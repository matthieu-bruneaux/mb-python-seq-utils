A set of various short scripts written in Python and used for sequence
manipulation, gene ontology manipulation and such.

If you use those scripts and find any error, please report it!

** Gene Ontology tools

See the [[https://github.com/matthieu-bruneaux/python-bioinformatic-utils/tree/master/gene_ontology][README]] file in the *gene_ontology* folder.

** Fasta CLI tools (=fasta-cli-tools=)

- =uniq-fasta.py=

  Script to report unique fasta sequences from one or several fasta
  files. Sequences are reported in the fasta format, using a hash of the sequence
  as the sequence name.

  Example usage:
  #+BEGIN_SRC bash
  # For one input file
  python uniq-fasta.py mySeq.fasta -o myUniqSeq.fasta
  cat mySeq.fasta | python uniq-fasta.py > myUniqSeq.fasta
  # For several input files
  cat *.fasta | python uniq-fasta.py > myUniqSeq.fasta
  #+END_SRC

** Fasta sequence file tools

Those tools are in the *sequences* folder. Each script performs a very simple
task.
