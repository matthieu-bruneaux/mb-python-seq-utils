A set of various short scripts written in Python and used for sequence 
manipulation, gene ontology manipulation and such.

If you use those scripts and find any error, please report it!

** Gene Ontology tools

See the [[https://github.com/matthieu-bruneaux/python-bioinformatic-utils/tree/master/gene_ontology][README]] file in the *gene_ontology* folder.

** Fasta sequence file tools

Those tools are in the *sequences* folder. Each script performs a very simple
task.
